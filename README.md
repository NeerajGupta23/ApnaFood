# Microservices Project

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Caching**: Redis  
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary  

## Description
This project follows a microservices architecture, utilizing multiple technologies to ensure scalability, efficiency, and robustness. The backend is built with Spring Boot, supporting both relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, while Redis is used for caching to optimize performance. Images are stored in **Cloudinary**, and their URLs are saved in MySQL for easy retrieval.

## Features
- **Microservices-based architecture**
- **React frontend for user interaction**
- **Spring Boot backend for business logic**
- **MySQL for structured data storage**
- **MongoDB for flexible document storage**
- **Redis cache to improve response time**
- **Cloudinary for secure and scalable image storage**

## Goals
- To build a scalable and efficient microservices-based system  
- To integrate multiple databases for different use cases  
- To leverage Redis for enhanced performance  
- To efficiently manage and store images using Cloudinary
